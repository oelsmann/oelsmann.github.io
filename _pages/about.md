I am a postdoctoral scientist in the [Department of River-Coastal Science and Engineering at the School of Science and Engineering](https://sse.tulane.edu/river), Tulane University, at [Soenke Dangendorf's sea-level change team](https://sse.tulane.edu/sonke-dangendorf), since January 2025. 
I hold a doctoral degree in Geodesy and Oceanography from the [Deutsches Geodätisches Forschungsinstitut](https://www.dgfi.tum.de/en/) at the Technical University of Munich and a master’s degree from the [University of Hamburg](https://mpimet.mpg.de/en/homepage). My research focuses on disentangling the individual components of regional coastal sea-level change. In addition to climate-induced sea-level rise, a significant portion of relative sea-level change at the coast results from vertical land motion, including subsidence and uplift driven by various geophysical processes. To quantify these contributions, I integrates multiple observational techniques—including coastal altimetry, tide gauges, GNSS, and InSAR—with models of ocean and solid Earth dynamics. Using these constraints, I develop and apply statistical frameworks to assess the drivers and impacts of past and future sea-level changes.
