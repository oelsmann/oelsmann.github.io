## Motivation
Among the many threats posed by global warming, potential changes in the Atlantic meridional
overturning circulation (AMOC) and sea-level rise loom large. Reduction in the AMOC’s heat transport
could alter hurricane activity, rainfall patterns, and land temperatures, while sea-level rise would cause
coastal flooding, loss of wetlands, and beach erosion. What’s more, ocean circulation and sea level are
coupled. We must understand how and why AMOC and sea level have changed in the past, and how those
changes were related, to project future changes and impacts.


Models project that the AMOC will decline or possibly collapse in the next century, and North
Atlantic coastlines will witness enhanced sea-level rise as a result. Yet, it is difficult to determine how
realistic these projections are. There is debate about whether AMOC has significantly changed since the
Industrial Revolution, because direct AMOC records are short in time and sparse in space. Hence, no
authoritative observational benchmark exists for comparing with long-term historical AMOC simulations
from models that are also used to project future changes, including of sea level.

[We propose](https://teams.issibern.ch/atlanticmeridionaloverturningcirculation) to convene a diverse, interdisciplinary Team to use data, modeling, and theory to
study the relationship between the AMOC and sea level, and to quantify the value sea-level data add to
ocean observing systems. Our proposal is timely given recent advances in space-based observations, data
processing algorithms, and the need to find alternatives for expensive in-situ AMOC monitoring arrays.
Results may inform historical AMOC reconstructions and projections of impacts from climate change.
