## Abstract

Vertical land movements can cause regional relative sea-level changes to
differ substantially from climate-driven absolute sea-level changes. Whereas
absolute sea level has been accurately monitored by satellite altimetry since
1992, there are limited observations of vertical land motion. Vertical land
motion is generally modelled as a linear process, despite some evidence
of nonlinear motion associated with tectonic activity, changes in surface
loading or groundwater extraction. As a result, the temporal evolution of
vertical land motion, and its contribution to projected sea-level rise and its
uncertainty, remains unresolved. Here we generate a probabilistic vertical
land motion reconstruction from 1995 to 2020 to determine the impact
of regional-scale and nonlinear vertical land motion on relative sea-level
projections up to 2150. We show that regional variations in projected
coastal sea-level changes are equally influenced by vertical land motion and
climate-driven processes, with vertical land motion driving relative sea-level
changes of up to 50 cm by 2150. Accounting for nonlinear vertical land
motion increases the uncertainty in projections by up to 1 m on a regional
scale. Our results highlight the uncertainty in future coastal impacts and
demonstrate the importance of including nonlinear vertical land motions in
sea-level change projections.
